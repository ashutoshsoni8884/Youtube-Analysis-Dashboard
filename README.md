## About Dataset

This dataset reveals various engagement metrics such as the number of views the video has received, likes and dislikes it has garnered from viewership. Additionally information related to comment count on particular videos enables analysis regarding viewer interaction and response. Furthermore with this dataset we can find whether comments or ratings are disabled for a particular video allowing examination into how these factors impact engagement.
